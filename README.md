# Gigstart-app
This app has been submitted as internship project under Greymeter http://greymeter.com for Gigstart http://www.gigstart.com/ . The app helps the user rate artists in real time. 
To achieve this real time functionality following technologies have been used:-
Frontend:- Angular JS- An MVW web application framework.
Backend :- Firebase- a real time JSON database to store and sync app data.

Firebase extends the 2-way data binding provided by Angular JS to 3-way databinding, thus realizing the real time activities.
